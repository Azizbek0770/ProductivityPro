Please go through the entire React + TypeScript (.tsx) SPA and make sure **EVERY section, feature, field, input, and button is fully functional** and correctly wired. This is a final QA + revive pass.

🎯 1. Buttons:
- All “Open” buttons on unlocked tools trigger a fake modal or `alert("Opening Tool: [tool name]")`
- All “Unlock” buttons on locked tools scroll to `PricingTiers` or show `alert("Upgrade to unlock")`
- "Copy referral link" buttons must copy to clipboard and show toast or alert
- All "Upgrade" buttons in StickyCTA and PricingTiers must set `userTier` accordingly and update context

🧠 2. Inputs & Forms:
- Email form should submit using Formspree or MailerLite endpoint (`import.meta.env`)
- Validate input, show success message (e.g., “Freebie sent!”)
- Referral link input field should be functional with `copy` support
- Invite button should simulate increasing `inviteCount` and upgrade tier if threshold hit

🔐 3. Context:
- `userTier` and `inviteCount` must update in real-time via `useContext(UserContext)`
- Persist both to `localStorage` on change, and restore on reload
- Changing tier should immediately unlock tools in ToolGrid

🛠️ 4. Modal or Simulated Popups:
- Clicking “Open” tool should show a popup/modal or at least an `alert`
- Optional: Create `ToolModal.tsx` to simulate tool previews
- Close modal button must work

🎨 5. UI Feedback:
- Add toasts or alerts on key actions:
  - “Copied!”
  - “Tool unlocked!”
  - “Upgrade required”
  - “Invite sent!”
  - “Thanks for signing up!”
- Use smooth transitions (`transition-all`, `ease-in-out`, `duration-300`)

📦 6. Logic Fixes:
- If `inviteCount >= 2` → `userTier = standard`
- If `inviteCount >= 5` → `userTier = pro`
- Update grid dynamically when tier changes
- Pro badge (🌟) should show if tier is "pro"

💬 7. AdPlaceholder:
- Add a visible box that says "Ad Placeholder"
- Leave comment for where AdSense script would go

✅ Final Step:
- Test all interactions: open tools, upgrade, copy links, invite friends, submit email form
- Ensure every component exports cleanly and app loads with no errors or warnings

Make this app fully alive — everything working, every interaction smooth, every field functional. This is the final touch to launch-ready status.
