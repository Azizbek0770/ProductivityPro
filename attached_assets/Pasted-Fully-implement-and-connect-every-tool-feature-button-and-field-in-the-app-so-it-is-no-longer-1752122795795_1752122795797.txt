Fully implement and connect **every tool, feature, button, and field** in the app so it is no longer demo or fake. Use React with TypeScript (.tsx) and Tailwind. Everything must be fully coded with real logic.

🎯 1. Tool Functionality:
- Create real logic for each tool in `ToolGrid`:
  - PomodoroTimer: timer, break/reset logic
  - TaskManager: add/edit/delete tasks, save to `localStorage`
  - SmartNotes: note editor with title/content, saved to `localStorage`
  - Calendar: interactive calendar using `react-calendar` or similar
  - Analytics: fake chart using dummy data + `recharts`
  - TeamCollab: simulated message board or Kanban UI
  - AIWritingAssistant: use OpenAI API if key present, or fake it with prompts
  - VoiceRecorder: use browser `MediaRecorder`
  - HabitTracker: daily checkbox grid with `localStorage` persistence

🧠 2. Inputs + Fields:
- Make all forms actually functional:
  - EmailSignup: send data via Formspree/MailerLite using `.env`
  - Referral field: generate + copy real UUID-based link
  - Invite button: simulate invite with tier upgrade when inviteCount reaches 2 or 5

🔐 3. Unlock Logic:
- If tool is locked, button = “Unlock” → scroll to PricingTiers
- If tool is unlocked, button = “Open” → shows modal or loads tool component

📦 4. Context + State:
- User tier and invite count are tracked in `UserContext.tsx`
- Save `userTier` and `inviteCount` to `localStorage`
- Restore on app load
- Re-render UI based on tier

💳 5. Payments:
- In PricingTiers, clicking upgrade simulates Stripe/Gumroad success
- On click → upgrade tier + update context + toast message

🧪 6. Everything Must Work:
- No dummy buttons
- No placeholder alerts unless tool is intentionally not implemented
- Show real modals, toasts, or component states

📱 7. Responsive and Smooth:
- Keep animations, hover effects, transitions
- Ensure tools are mobile-friendly

✅ Final Result:
The app must feel like a fully working productivity platform with real usable tools and no fake placeholders or broken parts. Make it real.
